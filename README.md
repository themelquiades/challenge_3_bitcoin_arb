# Bitcoin Arbitrade Analysis - January 2018 - March 2018
3rd weekly challenge, focused on data collection, preparation, and analysis to identify arbitrage opportunities across different bitcoin exchanges. The analysis showed that profits could be made through arbitrage by buying bitcoin at lower prices on one exchange while simulataneously selling at higher prices on another exchange. However, these profits dimished as the space matured and more participants took advantage of the opportunity, driving the exchanges closer to parity. Intra-day, the data also showed that more profits could be made in the morning than the afternoon as opportunities were taken advantage of and diminished.
